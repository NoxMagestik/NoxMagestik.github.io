### Firepoint
* Fluid combat - Player presses an action key while aiming at a node on an enemy then an attack key - the specific combination performs a different type of attack.
* Fluid movement - Wall run, frontflips, backflips, other gymnastics
* Dimension shift - Players can switch mid-fight to different dimensions, each with their own effect
These all make for extremely dynamic combat - the core of Firepoint.
