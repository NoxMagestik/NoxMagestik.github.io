# Current Project
## Firepoint
* Node-based Combat (NBC) - Player presses an action key while aiming at a node on an enemy then an attack key - the specific combination performs a different type of attack.
* Fluid movement - Wall run, frontflips, backflips, other gymnastics
* Plane-shift - Players can switch mid-fight to different dimensions, each with their own effect.
These all make for extremely dynamic combat - the core of Firepoint.
### How we aren't copying - the differentiators
* NBC and Plane-shift
* Multiplayer open-world planets with offshoot dungeons - each world has different requirements and status effects
* Compelling storyline
